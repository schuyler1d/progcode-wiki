# Onboarding Buddy
## Introduction

One of the most critical aspects to providing a continually improving, democratically driven community is making it as clear and straightforward as possible for new community members to contribute to the Prog Code community. In support of this, we want to establish an "onboarding buddy" process, wherein established members will be matched up new community members to help them get up to speed. The below outlines the initial Onboarding Buddy process

## Process

1. New potential team member registers on the [Prog Code Website](https://www.progcode.co/)
2. Applications reviewed for good fit
3. Volunteer staffer sends initial welcome email
4. Community member joins [Prog Code Slack](progcode.slack.com/)
6. Community Engagement Team welcomes new team members in #introduction
7. ProgCode Volunteer staff sends welcome direct message with link to [onboarding call](http://bit.ly/2lrVpqr)
8. Community member joins onboarding call, joins open discussion around [Prog Code values](https://medium.com/@joepbreslin/grassroots-tech-8676739a5960)
9. Volunteer staff leading onboarding call reviews [ProgCode Toolkit](toolkit.progcode.org/)
9. Volunteer staff utilizes [Onboarding Best Practices](https://docs.google.com/a/progcode.org/document/d/1Bib7mQzhovHdIzM8trzzNN1JkqzqrVmHvi-M9vJhwR4/edit?usp=sharing)
10. Community Engagement Team member joins onboarding call, is introduced as onboarding buddy for cohort

Onboarding buddy works with community member to develop and execute [Personal Action Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lN9LYlb975RUalJaT7HRUAdBjGnNc2WSkQMj9p_gPic/edit)
