# Description

The idea behind the partners hub is for us to reachout to networks outside in as effectively and as robust as possible. We recognize that there are multiple touch points upon which we can add on to the richness of the Progressive Coders Network, and there may be ways for us to collaborate and service various partners as strategically as possible.

The partners hub aims to maximize collaboration and increase the chances that a partner will be a successful member of the community. Partners hub should remove or minimize and sources of stress towards the success of a partner. The hub also makes sure that the partners are autonomous and that the ownership of each is strong.

The nodes within partners hub has certain characteristics, most of which is grounded on the idea that they champion the interests of our partners or possible partners.

### Out of scope partners

These are partnerships that require full servicing, that needs high accountability and tight deadlines, or high demand for attention. These partners would have very specific non-generalizable needs that may not be open-sourced, and we remain to work openly with them. 

For these types of partners, we would still be open in working with them, although it is best to direct them to a dev shop that will have high form of accountability. These would redirected to dev-shop partners that may be open to paid services, and are aligned with ProgCode values.

Initial service may include scoping, open collaboration, and other services that members may be comfortable to take on probono, but we must be clear that these are not required and everything is non-committal. This can be evident both in organizational or application partners.

# Nodes

The following nodes make up the partners hub.

## Strategic Partnerships

To preface this. There are three types of partners within the ProgCode ecosystem.

### Application Partners

Applications that we support within the community. The projects that we put high important in building capacity for the grassroots movement.

### Organizational Partners

These are partners we empower through the tools we’ve made and represent the grassroots.

### Service Partners

These are partners who’s services coincide with what the community does not offer organizational or application partners. Such as, microsites that have tight deadlines which noone in the community may be interested in doing.

Strategic Partnership node aims for these different actors to be coherent with each other, and provide a space for an effective interfacing with those three and the community at large. Further more, the strategic partnership has to be the point to person of the partner advocates as to be discussed in the next section.

The strategic partnerships will provide guidelines and necessary context to all the strategic parts of the house in terms. It has to provide guidance for partner advocates and communications with the service partners and proper guidelines with each type of partners.

## Partner Advocacy

Partner advocates are the ones who champion the interests of the partners, and aims to maximize their experiences in the community. We want to have a seamless communications channel between the partners and the community, allowing them to know how to effectively interface with ProgCode. 

Partner advocates also need to be the point to person of each partners, the main goal of which is to not have any confusion within the partners and provide a robust service to them.

## Issue Advocacy

Issue advocates would champion an issue and reach out to organizations necessary to attain or service an issue. We need to provide support to organizations that are working towards achieving the push for issues that are important to the progressive movement.
