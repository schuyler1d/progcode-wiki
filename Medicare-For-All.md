# Description

Drive majority of discussions and strategies (messaging, empowerment, research, resources, partnerships) onto highlighting and supporting the drive for Medicare for All.

As we have stated, we are focusing on the progressive issues that are at the forefront of our society. ProgCode is a community driven by issues, and as we are aiming to be the technological support arm of the Progressive grassroots movement, we must aim to highlight/amplify/provide support to the community at large.

# FAQs

#### Are there any asks for the broader community, or are you just looking for a thumbs up as to what you'll be focusing on for the next three weeks?

**Question**
> I took a brief look at the github page.  Before voting one way or another, I'd like to have a better idea of what "focusing on Healthcare" means.  From what I'm seeing in the strategy document, it looks to be mostly communications work that you'd be doing (or maybe the "leadership team", whoever that is at the moment).  Are there any asks for the broader community, or are you just looking for a thumbs up as to what you'll be focusing on for the next three weeks?

**Answer** 
It's more on driving the messaging on the media/outreach, and highlighting issues for the next three weeks. 

It also provides us with the confidence of reaching out more to healthcare initiatives and organizations who are pushing for Universal Healthcare.
