# Abstract

For decision arbitration or in times of conflict, we will follow to the best of our capacity ProgCode standards:

We resolve through conversation. If conversation is not enough, parties can call for a vote within the call or parties can choose to have the issue voted by the community, in which case we will post the issue in #community-vote

Parties can invoke a full stop of the conversation, in which case it will and must be tabled until such time that we are ready to revisit. Parties must be aware that these actions take considerable social capital.


Resolutions are then added to our precedents, which will inform any future conflicts that may arise.

## 08 Jan 2017: Sudden Archiving of Channels
Due to inactivity of channels, Dave opted to archive channels within the slack team. This was met with questions by Jason as it has been perceived as overriding ownership of members to the channels they have created and a discussion has been started about a channelâ€™s inactivity.

Discussion was then started by Dave, Jason, Joe, and Rapi about the relationship of channel creators and what signals archiving them sends. It was resolved through discussion, no vote was requested.  

In the end, the channels were unarchived, and the idea of ownership within the community was underlined.
Please refer to this chat log.

## 12 Dec 2016: Using @ in #team-announcements

### Overview
We have had a lot of comments from the community about limiting or managing the amount of announcements we have been pushing out. We would like to know how the community feels about the announcements we do in #team-announcements! Should we:
Not change anything. One to three `@ channel` announcements a day is fine
Only one `@ channel` announcement per day, the rest should not have a notification
Only once a week `@ channel` please! The rest should not have `@ channel`
As rare as possible. Once a month or only for really important things. The rest should not have `@ channel`

Vote for this ends on Wednesday, Dec 14. Goes without saying that you can vote as many as you want. 

### Actors
Community at large. Multiple members have raised the issue on the timeliness and frequency of the team-announcement notifications.

### Resolution
15 members voted on one `@ channel` announcement per day, the rest should not have a notification
