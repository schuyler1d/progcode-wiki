# Can you support political campaigns?
In accordance with our non-profit status, ProgCode and any entity it manages may not coordinate directly with a campaign. However, this does not mean politicians cannot adopt tools and applications created by ProgCode community member

One of our most important values is project autonomy. What this means is that applications that coordinate within ProgCode are welcome to do so however they prefer as long as it is in accordance with our community and legal guidelines. ProgCode does not own any applications from within the community
