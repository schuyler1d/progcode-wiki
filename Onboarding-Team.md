# Onboarding Buddy
## Introduction

One of the most critical aspects to providing a continually improving, democratically driven community is making it as clear and straightforward as possible for new community members to contribute to the Prog Code community. In support of this, we want to establish an "onboarding buddy" process, wherein established members will be matched up new community members to help them get up to speed. The below outlines the initial Onboarding Buddy process

## Process

1. New potential team member registers on the [Prog Code Website](https://www.progcode.co/)
2. Applications reviewed for good fit
3. Rapi sends initial welcome email
4. Community member joins [Prog Code Slack](progcode.slack.com/)
5. @progbot sends direct message with key information
6. Community Engagement Team welcome new team members in #introduction
7. Joe sends welcome direct message with link to [onboarding call](https://zoom.us/meeting/register/c07b1af895b269f3cde7dc3c8da9331e), copies Rapi
8. Community member joins onboarding call, joins open discussion around [Prog Code values](https://medium.com/@joepbreslin/grassroots-tech-8676739a5960)
