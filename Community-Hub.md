# Description

Focus on, and champion the interest of the members. The community hub focuses on the dynamics surrounding the interactions of the organization and community, and the community with partners. The community hub champions the interest of the community and its members, maximizing experiences and success. Aiming to have full participation and minimize the churn of members who may not be able to see value from our community.

# Nodes

The following are the nodes that makeup the community hub

## Onboarding

The onboarding node maximizes the participation and hastens the buy-in of the members to the Progressive Coders culture. The aim of this node is to minimize confusion on how to  participate and enable the user to maximize their experience in ProgCode. This node focuses on providing clear steps, and as much as possible enable the member to find a project that resonates with them.

## Culture

Culture is what an HR would be in an ideal world. Culture node resides in the Community Hub as it is and will always be on the side of ProgCode members. It will uphold the interest of the members and make sure that along with it, we uphold the ideals of autonomy, ownership, collaboration, and all the items indicated in our volunteer staffer guidelines.

Culture aims to uphold the community’s values and norms, and facilitate in disputes if necessary.

Culture node also focuses on the ideas of inclusion, empowerment and intersectionality throughout the network, and is tasked to bake in self-care into the community.

## Member Success & Services

Member success and services provides means for members to realize the success metric they have set for themselves. Maximize the chances of success for the users, and provide a way for the member to be invested in the community as ProgCode provides a form of investment to them individually.

Examples of this is sponsorship to different conferences and provide means for people to find trainings that will increase their skills – for free if possible.

## Evangelism

This node provides means for the community to gain more people by going to the public upfront and provide a space for individuals who may not know about ProgCode to know who we are. Joining and finding ways to take part in conferences, hackathons, and build relationships with meetups would be one way of acting in the Evangelism node. This is also closely related to partnerships.
