# Abstract

This page provides context on those who are eligible for services of ProgCode. These are aimed to provide clear instructions on who we can serve, inline with our 501(c)(3) non-profit legal status.

With regards to setting budget projections, there are budget targets and services that are provided to various benefactors: operations, grassroots organizations, individuals, and partner applications. There are various conditions that have to be met before we can legally provide services to eligible recipients. This is covered in the service conditions hereafter.

# Service Conditions

* The project should be either open source and/or a low-cost/at-cost solution for an existing problem.
* The benefactor should either be a non-entity or a non-profit. At the moment, we are finding ways to provide service to projects that choose a for-profit path, that are within the bounds of the law. 
* It should be a non-partisan project, meaning it should not be in collaboration or coordination with a political party or candidate. 
* It should have the inherent objective of servicing and providing support for the grassroots movement. 
* It should reflect or have an inherent effect of achieving progressive values of racial, environmental, gender, social, and economic justice.
* It should not violate  progressive values of racial, environmental, gender, social, and economic justice, and the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights)
* It must have in some way or another aim to remove the influence of big money in politics.

# Decision Making 

Aside from these, before becoming a benefactor, one should be a partner that has been consented to by the volunteer staff team, and at the same time has had the blessing of the community through a community vote. For details on the decision making process, please checkout this ProgCode Wiki entry on [Decision Making](https://github.com/ProgressiveCoders/functions/wiki/Change-Process).
